|   Pseudocode for calculator   |

Stage: start. 
    Accept input number. If first number is not filled remove current display and display input. If first 
    input is comma (.) only accept input if there is no comma in display already. Also if first number is not filled 
    keep 0 and add a comma. If first number is filled add input to the current display. After choosing a number the user can either choose a 
    operator or press sum. if sum is pressed do nothing, if operator is pressed store input nr in nr1, store operator 
    input in operator variable, set firstNrFilled to false and set stage to nr1Operator 

Stage: nr1Operator. 
    At this stage we have nr1 and operator. From here, the user can input a new number, press operator or 
    press sum. 

    If sum is pressed, store display value to nr2, run and store sum function with nr1, nr2 and operator, to sum 
    variable. Check for decimals, if more than 4 round. Set stage to start and firstNrFilled to false. 
    Pressing sum again should do nothing. Also check for too large numbers.

    If operator is pressed, store display value to nr2, run and store sum function. heck for decimals, if more than 4 
    round. Display sum value, update operator with the new operator, set firstNrFilled to false and copy nr1 
    to be sum value. Also check for too large numbers.
